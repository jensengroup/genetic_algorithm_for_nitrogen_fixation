# Discovery of nitrogen fixation catalysts with genetic algorithms

Code repository for the paper [Discovery of molybdenum based nitrogen fixation catalysts with genetic algorithms](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2024/SC/D4SC02227K).

1. [Run](#how-to-run)
1. [Parameters](#parameters)

## How to run

To setup an environment for running the GA, activate a conda environment with pip installed and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

Then ensure you have installed [`xtb`](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html) in the environment.

To do a simple GA run, activate the environment and run:

```
python genetic_algorithm_driver.py --scoring_func calculate_score --partition kemi1 --generations 1 --filename data/ligands.smi --debug --population_size 4 --molecules_per_chunk 2 --cpus_per_chunk 2 --sa_screening --CovalentLigands 3 --DativeLigands 1 --opt loose --n_confs 2
```
